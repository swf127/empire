# The sector types (column uid) must match the compiled-in types
# defined in sect.h.

# Sector terrain (column terra) is the uid of the underlying terrain
# sector type.  Sector types that occur in that column are terrain
# types, and must have themselves as terrain.

# Available products (column prd) are in product.config.  Navigation
# types (column nav) are in compiled-in table sector-navigation.
# Packing types (column pkg) are in compiled-in table packing.

# Players can only designate sectors with a non-negative value in
# column cost, and only to something with the same terrain.  All
# sectors with the same terrain and non-negative cost should have the
# same population limit (column maxp), or else players can abuse
# redesignation to mass-murder people.

# A sector with urban packing (urba in column pkg) is a big city.
# Column maxp applies at 0% efficiency.  The limit at 100% is ten
# times as large, up to the general item limit 9999.

# Do not edit this file to customize a game!  Create your own custom
# configuration file(s), best next to your econfig, and name them in
# econfig key custom_tables.
