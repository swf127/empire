This file contains a list of known contributors to Empire (either
in coding, testing, ideas or moral support. :) )

Empire is a multi-player, client/server Internet based war game. It
is distributed in two main parts, a server, where the game actually
runs, and clients that connect to the server.  The server portion
ships with a basic client.  This basic client is also available
seperately.  There are also many third-party clients available.

Empire is based on a game written in the late 70s/early 80s by Peter
Langston.  Since he wouldn't give out the source code, a large reverse
engineering/re-coding project was undertaken to create a new version
of this game and make the source available for all.  Since that time,
the Empire code has changed drastically and been re-written numerous
times, and none of that original code exists (other than in fond
memories) in this code base anymore.

There have been various "stages" of Empire development.  At this point
in time (October, 1998) there have been 5 major stages identified,
each with a leading author.  They are as follows (with successsive
projects building on the projects before it):

  Dave Pare <mr-frog@smarttouch.com> (UCSD/BSD)
  Jeff Bailey <bailey@mcs.kent.edu> (KSU (1.04) Distribution of BSD)
  Thomas Ruschak <ts@ecn.purdue.edu> (Chainsaw)
  Ken Stevens <KStevens@GlobeandMail.ca> (3.0.x)
  Steve McClure <ionica@empire.cx> (Wolfpack)

It is due to these above people pulling projects together that the
Empire server has gotten to where it is today.

Empire is copyrighted and released by the 5 people above under the GNU
GPL.  See files README, COPYING and CREDITS for related information
and legal notices.  It is expected that future projects/authors will
amend these files as needed.  The source files have been updated to
reflect this license, and much erroneous data (such as bogus file
headers) has been fixed.

Empire source code has always been freely available, with the intent
of it always being freely available, it was just never properly
copyrighted or licensed until the first release under the GNU GPL
(4.2.0).  It is our goal to keep Empire source free and available at all
times.

Also see the "History" info file for a more detailed listing of
the history of Empire.

Currently (June, 2003), Empire development is being led by the
Wolfpack team.  You can find them at <http://www.wolfpackempire.com/>
or e-mail <wolfpack@wolfpackempire.com>.

In addition, the people below are recognized as having either given
code to the above authors, submitted patches, helped on various
aspects of the projects (such as info pages), play tested, submitted
bug reports, bounced ideas, etc.

Many of the source files have no listed known contributors due to the
fact that many, many people contributed anonymously.  For those where
we knew who contributors were, we listed them in the header.  It is
hoped that in the future contributors will put their names into this
list at the top of the file, and that new files have the same type of
header applied to them for future tracking (though obviously it is
not required.)

We are sure that the list below is most likely incomplete, and anyone
who doesn't see your name on the below list, don't be offended, we
didn't mean it!  Just send us an e-mail letting us know and we'll be
more than happy to add you.  Also, let us know your latest e-mail
address if you'd like it included.
