This page describes fallout, and some of its effects.

Fallout is the result of nuclear bombs going off.  It is basically
just radioactive particles that float around in the air.

After nuclear blasts, these particles are thrust into the atmosphere,
and take a long time to dissipate.  In addition, these particles
may spread from sector to sector.

When a sector has fallout, during the update, things in that sector
may die, melt, whatever from the radiation.  The way it works is this:

1) All sectors that have fallout are checked, and things there are
   affected by the fallout.  People die, commodities melt, etc.  This
   includes anything on land units and on ships within that sector.

2) Next, fallout may spread from sector to sector, depending on the
   amount of fallout in the sector.  Note that fallout will spread
   outward from ground zero, in all directions, at a maximum rate of
   1 sector per update.

3) Lastly, fallout decays.  Any fallout that is left decays.  Decay
   usually happens in 1/2 life mode, which means 1/2 the given fallout
   in a sector (after spreading around) dies...

Finally, if you are reading this info page, it probably means that
you are trying to figure out what fallout is going to do to your
country.  Well, good luck, so are we. :)
