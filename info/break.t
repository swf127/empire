.SY "break"
In Empire your sectors are initially sanctuaries.
While in sanctuary your people don't eat, work or reproduce.
They also can't be attacked.
.s1
Break removes the sanctuary protection from your country and forces
your people to work for a living.
Sanctuaries become capitals, unless the deity set up a different new
designation.
You can't do any country development commands until you break out
of sanctuary.
