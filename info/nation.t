The max safe population is the highest population in an ordinary
sector such as a mine
that will NOT forfeit some population growth during an update.
In the example above, if you have 427 civs in a sector, you are
guaranteed not to have more than 556 after population growth.
If you have more than 427, population growth would make you go
over 556, and the excess babies would be eliminated when the
population was reduced to 556.
.s1
If you have at least the happiness mentioned in the last line,
your sector's loyalty won't have a chance to go down. Otherwise,
each update, the chance is the number above - your happiness / 5.0.
For the country above, the chance would be (4.385283-2.01)/5.0 = .475 = 47%
chance that any individual sector's loyalty would go down.
