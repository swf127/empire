The upgrade command allows a country to set the tech level
of its ships/land units/planes to the country's current tech level.
.s1
Each ship/land unit/plane to be upgraded must be at least 60%
efficient and be in one of the country's
harbors/headquarters/airports that is at least 60% efficient.
.s1
Upgrading costs 15% of the full build cost in money and avail, and
reduces the efficiency of the ship/land unit/plane by 35%.  Repairing
these 35% will then consume work and resources as usual.
