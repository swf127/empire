The estimated delta may not be correct, due to events during updates:
starvation, plague, sector revolts, etc.
.s1
Budget takes into account avail and materials in headquarters,
harbors and airports, and will
only show you how much you'll pay for work that will actually get done
in cases where your headquarters/airports/harbors will not have enough avail
or materials to work on all units/planes/ships.

.L "Going broke"
.s1
The first thing you need to know about going broke: don't!  Stuff you
can't afford will not be made.  Lack of maintenance will damage your
assets.  Worst of all, because many commands are not available while
you're broke, you'll be helpless until you become solvent again
.s1
There is no easy way to predict what exactly will still be paid for
when you go broke during an update.  Try info \*QUpdate-sequence\*U.

.L "Cutting cost"
.s1
The orthodox way to balance your budget is to sack a neighbor.  In
case that isn't possible right now, a few tips:
.s1
Stop expensive sectors, ships, planes and land units.  See the
\*Qstart\*U and \*Qstop\*U commands for how.
.s1
Instead of stopping a sector, you can throttle it by moving out some
of the raw materials required for production.  The \*Qproduction\*U
command can help you fine tune.
.s1
Trim your military.  Consider demobilizing.
