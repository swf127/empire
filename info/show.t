.TH Command SHOW
.NA show "Characteristics of sectors, units, updates and more"
.LV Basic
.SY "show <land|nuke|plane|sector|ship> [b|s|c] [tech]"
.SY "show <bridge|item|news|product|tower>"
.SY "show <updates> [number]"
The show command shows characteristics of sectors, units (ships,
planes, land units and nukes), bridges (spans and towers), items, news
and products, as well as information on updates.
.s1
Characteristics are more fully described in separate info
pages (Ship-types, Nuke-types, etc.).
.s1
For sectors and units, a
further parameter is required to indicate whether you wish information
about building (b), statistics (s) or capabilities (c) of the selected
type.
.s1
By default, unit characteristics are shown at 1.25 times your current
technology level.  You can ask for a lower level with the optional
tech parameter.  Units beyond that level are not shown; you can only
get information on units that you are already or almost capable of
building.
.s1
So, for example
.EX show nuke capabilities
will give something like
.NF
