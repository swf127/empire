.NA anti "anti-terrorist actions"
.LV Basic
.SY "anti <SECTS>"
.s1
 The anti-guerrilla command is used to remove che from any sector.
The command take the following form:
.EX anti <SECTS>
.s1
Once issued, the strength of the che is
compared to the number of mil in the sector.  The maximum number of mil
allowed to fight is equal to the mobility in the sector.  Che receive a
combat multiplier which may or may not make
them tougher to kill.  There are only
three outcomes for this command.

.NF
   1)  The mil kill all the che.  The sector is cleared (for now).
   2)  The che kill the mil.  The sector then returns to the old owner with
       most or all of the che reverting to mil.  The old owner is sent a
       telegram informing him of the event.
   3)  The battle is suspended when the mobility in the sector is used up.
       Each mil or che killed uses one mobility point.
.FI
.s1
Units do not participate in the anti command.  A sector can revert
to the old owner while your units are stuck in it.
.s1
Note that che are finicky.  If you manage to lose a sector fighting them,
they do unpredictable things.
They may all come out of hiding to join the
military.  A few may stay in hiding while the majority come out to join
the military.  Who knows what else they may do.
