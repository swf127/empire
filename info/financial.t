so that the loan sharks can better calculate
the ability of a prospective client to pay.

It does not show loan offers pending, however,
just those loans which have been accepted.

If a loan is past due (i.e. the loanee has defaulted on the loan) the
"(in arreras)" is printed after the line of that loan.  Loans in default
may be "sharked" up and collected upon.
