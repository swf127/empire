Sheep are a vital part of Empire.  They may not display as actual
commodities, but they do exist as part of the game.  Introduced to the
game circa 1990, they have played a vital role in the conquests of
empires.  Not only was it not enough to kill all of your enemy's
civilians, but the sheep were in danger too.  Spinoffs on the concept
occurred, and these variants further added to the dementia induced by
playing too much Empire.
