Most of Empire consists of you moving something from one place to
another.  The following table tells you which commands you use
to move the kind of thing that you want to move.

Note that in the case of load, lload, unload, tend, and lunload, the
way you specify whether you are moving a commodity, land unit or plane
is by using the word "land" or "plane" instead of the commodity name
in the <WHAT> field.  If <WHAT> is "land" or "plane", then <NUM> is
the unit or plane id.  So for example, to load ship #1 with land unit
#2, you would type:
.EX "load land 1 2"
