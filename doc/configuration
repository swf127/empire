			Configuring your Empire server

Every option within the server has been made Run-time configurable.

But, certain things may break if you begin a game and start changing
options.  One specific thing you cannot change once you have created
a world is the WORLD_X and WORLD_Y.  If you change these values, you
will need to rebuild your world.

Most of the other options you should be able to change on the fly.  Of
course, you probably won't want to be changing options in the middle of
a game.  But, you should be able to turn them on/off safely.  Certain
things might get funny (like if you turn on/off HIDDEN in the middle
of a game for example) but the server should remain stable.

See the "doc/econfig" for a better description of how the Empire config
works, and see the "data/econfig" file for a better description of each
of the configurable settings in the server.  (You may also want to
check out the "info.nr/Options" file for more information on individual
options.)
