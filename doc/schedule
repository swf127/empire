This file documents how to configure update schedules.  The server
reads its update schedule from the file schedule in the same directory
as its econfig.

Comments start with # and extend to the end of the line.

Each non-blank line contains a directive.  Directives are:

* Single update: a time.

  Time can be specified in a number of formats:

  - ISO 8601: 2007-05-28 16:13

  - Like ctime: Dec 22 15:35 2006

  - Like RFC 2822: 22 Dec 2006 15:35

  - Relative to anchor: next Fri 15:35

    The time of day is optional.  The anchor is the last update
    defined by single update directives.  It defaults to the current
    time rounded up to the next minute.

* Repeating updates after anchor: every 24 hours, every 10 minutes

  Does not change the anchor.

  Optionally followed by a limit: until T, where T specifies a time.
  An update precisely at T is within the limit.

* Skip update: skip T, where T specifies a time.

A blitz schedule can be defined with a single line:

    every 10 minutes

Here's how to schedule updates Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 20:00,
starting June 1st 2007, skipping July 4th:

    2007-06-01 20:00    # a Friday
    every 168 hours
    next mon
    every 168 hours
    next wed
    every 168 hours
    skip 2007-07-04 20:00

The server reads the schedule file on startup, after an update, on the
reload command, and on catching SIGHUP.  You can use the utility
program empsched to test a schedule before you install it.
