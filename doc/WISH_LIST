-=O EMPIRE WISH LIST O=-

This is the complete Empire Wish List. Each item on the wish list has
been given a unique reference number. The reference number does not
indicate priority; it is only there so that we may easily refer to
various items on the list. The reference numbers are permanent, and
any new item added to the wish list in the future will be given a new
unique reference number.

The blank index number at the bottom of each section refers to the
next available index number for that section.

Note that the most radical have been moved out of the EMPIRE WISH LIST
and onto the EMPIRE WACKY IDEAS LIST which shares the same indexing system
as this file.

  --- ATTACK, ASSAULT AND BOARD --- 
  
a12
aborting an attack should cost you btus or possibly mobility
(otherwise you get info for free).

a13

  --- MISSIONS --- 
  
m7
Allow people to specify relation level to trigger different missions
(note there is already space for this in the nation struct).

m8

  --- SHIPS --- 
  
s4
For ship/plane/unit specification, allow a/13/b/15/16/c type
specification where fleets, wings, and armies may be included along
with numbers.  (WARNING: This would require massive restructuring.)

s13
once ships on sail have arrived at their destination, the "Your fleet
lead by ship #x has reached x,y." in production report every time.

s22
Another suggestion related to s21. The gain in efficiency of planes on
carriers or sufficiently crewed ships on sea should use construction
materials etc. This is to make it consistent with land units gaining
efficiency in a sector where the necessary materials are present.
Otherwise it leads to abuse: Say in the beginning of the game I build
a ship but don't want to spend the hcms to build it completely - so I
just crew it it will gain efficiency by itself. I think it could
easily be implemented by giving every ship some capacity for lcms and
hcm's.

s24

  --- PLANES --- 
  
p10
chh [38:382]% scrap p 28,0 ?eff<50
Really scrap all planes in 28,0 [n]? n
The prompt is misleading.  (Same goes for scuttle).  Scuttle and scrap
should probably be consolidated.

p17

  --- LAND UNITS --- 
  
l14
perhaps since land units in mountains are so hard to attack, we shuold
just not let land units into mountains to begin with.

l16

  --- COMMODITIES AND SECTORS --- 
  
c8
Change bridges (and towers) so that they only crumble when shelled
below 15%. Allows attackers an extra chance for a bridge attack.

c13
feed <SECTS> <SECT>
If a sector in <SECTS> needs more food, send it food from <SECT>.

c16 - WARNING - may be difficult to code
forts should return fire even if shot missed

c19

  --- INFORMATION COMMANDS --- 
  
i5
neweff [s <SHIPS>|p <PLANES>|l <UNITS>] to show the efficiency these
things will have after the update. At present you can only get this
info by doing some heavy calculations.

i10
gstarve <SECTS>
lists sectors that need more food if they want to attain maximum civ
growth.

i12
prod
should list the commodities consumed in f h * ! sectors for building
stuff. (This would help you calculate your production deltas.)

i16
bmap <SECTS> sh
to show enemy ships (that you would see with radar or coastwatch).

i17
bmap <SECTS> sa
to show enemy satellites (that you would see on radar).

i18
dump
should give you the oldown number, rather than just a *. (Does dump
only give you a * if you're not the oldown? I don't know. You can find
the oldown using ?oldown= so dump should give it to you).

i20
radar [<SHIPS> | <SECTS>] S
shows enemy ships but not your own.

i22
cen * ?connect=<SECT>
lists all sectors connected by land to <SECT>. Handy for setting up
territories.

i24
Allow | as well as & in selection syntax. e.g. res * ?des=o|des=g
(WARNING: cannot use single bar as the or character because "|" is
used as a pipe in the standard client and possibly in other clients.
Another character should be used instead ( or maybe "||"?)

i27

  --- TELEGRAMS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, NEWS --- 
  
t2
Separate BULLETIN's from Telegrams (so that when we're in the middle
of a fight we will know if we were just attacked or we simply have
just received a letter from a friend).

t9
When you are writing a telegram or an announcement and an update hits,
then your telegram or announcement gets lost. ( is it even POSSIBLE to
fix this?)

t10

  --- UPDATES --- 
  
u5
Planes should not be built by conquered populace. (The problem here is
that building planes uses mil, and you can lose the sector because all
your mil that was being used to hold the sector disappeared into the
planes so you loose the sector at the update.)  ALREADY FIXED?

u9

  --- DEITY --- 
  
d3
Add che (target and number) to deity dump format.

d8

  --- MISCELLANIOUS AND DOCUMENTATION --- 
  
x1
Often BTU's aren't updated immediately, and the prompt is out of sync
with the actual amount of BTU's they have.

x6
info takeover, avail, loyalty
There should be man pages on these.

x26
